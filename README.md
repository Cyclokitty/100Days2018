# 100 Days of Code for 2018! #

## January 1, 2018 ##
For the last 4 months I've been extremely busy completing an intense Mobile Applications Developer program with Seneca College and the Toronto YWCA. 

It was a heck of a program! I learned Java, OOP, iOS app making, Objective-C, Swift, and Android app making. As well as taking a weekend long Scrum Master course (exam will be completed in the next day or so), and later this week I'm starting a 2.5 week Salesforce course.

My longterm plans for the next 100 days include building more Android and iOS apps, learning React Native, getting back into Node.js web development, and checking out ReasonML that all the cool kids at FCC's gitter chat are cooing over these days. As well as getting accepted as an intern in either web development or mobile development.
